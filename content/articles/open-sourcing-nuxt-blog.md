Of course, there are some excellent headless CMS that I could use. But I found it a little over the top for a small blog like mine. It was also my wish to write new blog articles with markdown files, which then appear automatically. I chose [@nuxt/content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) for this kind of job.

If you use the Node Package Manager, then can you inject it directly in your project with:

```bash
npm install @nuxt/content
```

**Here are some features:**
- Blazing fast hot reload in development
- Vue components in Markdown
- Full-text search
- Support static site generation with nuxt generate
- Powerful QueryBuilder API (MongoDB like)
- Syntax highlighting to code blocks in markdown files using PrismJS.
- Handles Markdown, CSV, YAML, JSON(5)
- Extend with hooks

That sounds fantastic to me and is more than what I wanted.
I highly recommend taking a look at the official documentation to get the stone rolling.
It's the first time I using it, and let me tell you it's freaking amazing. **Thank you, Telmo for the inspiration**.

If you want to use my project to code and build your own website, then go for it. But make sure to remove any references of my name and use yours :-)

By the way, I use some Font Awesome Pro icons, if you haven't a pro licence, then you have to replace it with a free icon pack.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
